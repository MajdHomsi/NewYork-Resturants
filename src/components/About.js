        Hello there! I am currently in my 4th Semester at Seneca College,
        Throughout my journey so far, I fell in love with JavaScript and
        front-end development as it was so fun doing all the various projects
        that we have done throughout the semesters. I am currently A full time
        Senior Client Analyst at a software company where I get to lead a team
        and help Paramedics throughout Ontario with our Software that we provide
        for them. I am looking forward to further learning JavaScript and
        front-end development and become proficient at it and more comfortable.
